[ ] redirect command output to log and prefix with package name
[ ] feature flags: defined in package (along w/ args etc), chosen in solution
[ ] system packages: run probes (pkgconfig, etc)
[ ] configurable remote names
[ ] multiple remotes
[ ] forced repo update (depending on solution settings)
[ ] solution: package-config overrides recursively (overwrites individual subkeys within source nodes)
[X] let individual packages be built directly from workdir, instead of cloning (eg github)
[ ] move .DONE files out of the source trees
[ ] automatic rebuild on source changed (eg. use git hash etc for marker) --> trigger rebuild of dependants ?
